# C ComplexNumbers [Warning: In Production]
## Credits
This module was made with the help of [Ambesiwe Sonka](https://github.com/Ambesiwe).

## Overview
This module is for complex number operations in C.<br>
With it, you can create, edit, and do computations with complex numbers, including but not limited to:
- Complex number multiplication
- Getting the magnitude of a complex number
- Getting the conjugate of a complex number

In this folder, test.c was made to test the module.<br>
It can also be used as a reference to see how the module was intended to be used.

## How To Use
Copy the header and implementation files anywhere where your C-compiler can find it (usually at the standard directory or in the same directory as your main file). Then import the module like you would any other module, using `#include`.
