# Introduction
This is a collection of libraries/modules I've programmed in C, targetted towards electrical or embedded systems engineers.
# Libraries
## ComplexNumbers [Warning: In Production]
This module is for complex number operations in C.<br>
With it, you can create, edit, and do computations with complex numbers, including but not limited to:
- Complex number multiplication
- Getting the magnitude of a complex number
- Getting the conjugate of a complex number
- Sine and cosine of an angle in radians

## DataHandling
This module is for interpretting and processing data in C.<br>
Some functionality this module offers is:
- Getting the cumulative sum of data
- Sorting data in ascending order, or reversing the order
- Getting the mean, variance and standard deviation of a set of data

## DigitalSignalProcessing [Warning: In Production]
This module is for interpretting and processing digital signals in C.<br>
Some functionality this module offers is:
- Getting the DC or AC components of a signal
- Getting the energy and power of a signal
- Bringing a signal to and from the frequency domain (Fourier)

## Matrices
This module is for matrix operations in C.<br>
With it, you can create, edit, and do computations with matrices, including but not limited to:
- Matrix multiplication
- Getting the determinant of a square matrix
- Getting the inverse of a square matrix
- Guass elimination into Reduced Row Echelon form
- Solving for vectors, using a transformation and matrix of resulting vectors
