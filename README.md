# Introduction
This is a collection of libraries/modules I've programmed in C, targetted towards electrical or embedded systems engineers.
 # Libraries
 ## ComplexNumbers [Warning: In Production]
This module is for complex number operations in C.<br>
With it, you can create, edit, and do computations with complex numbers, including but not limited to:
- Complex number multiplication
- Getting the magnitude of a complex number
- Getting the conjugate of a complex number
- Sine and cosine of an angle in radians

 ## DataHandling [Warning: In Production]
This module is for interpretting and processing data, including time-domain related operations, in C.<br>
Some functionality this module offers is:
- Getting the mean, variance and standard deviation of a set of data
- Getting the cumulative sum of data
- Getting the energy and power of a signal

 ## Matrices
 This module is for matrix operations in C.<br>
With it, you can create, edit, and do computations with matrices, including but not limited to:
- Matrix multiplication
- Getting the determinant of a square matrix
- Getting the inverse of a square matrix
- Guass elimination into Reduced Row Echelon form
- Solving for vectors, using a transformation and matrix of resulting vectors
