## Overview
This module is for matrix operations in C.<br>
With it, you can create, edit, and do computations with matrices, including but not limited to:
- Matrix multiplication
- Getting the determinant of a square matrix
- Getting the inverse of a square matrix
- Guass elimination into Reduced Row Echelon form
- Solving for vectors, using a transformation and matrix of resulting vectors

In this folder, test.c was made to test the module.<br>
It can also be used as a reference to see how the module was intended to be used.
